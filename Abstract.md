Association between Unemployment, Mental Distress and Violent Crime

*Introduction*: Violent crime has dropped since the 90s, but from 2019-2020, there was an unprecedented rise. Unemployment and mental distress have both historically been linked with crime. Thus, the primary objective of this study is to analyze the associations between violent crime and unemployment, with a secondary objective of analyzing the associations between mental distress and violent crime in 33 American cities from 2014-2019.

*Methods*: A Negative Binomial regression was conducted using data from the Big Cities Health Coalition, BCHC, to analyze the associations between violent crime rate per 100,000 people and unemployment percentage while controlling for a city’s population density, per-capita household income, percentage of minorities, change in unemployment, and a city’s segregation dissimilarity index. Change in unemployment was calculated by subtracting ACS estimates from 2019 and 2014. The association between adult mental distress and violent crime was also analyzed. 

*Results*: After adjusting for covariates, the incidence rate of violent crime rate per 100,000 increased by 19% when unemployment increased by 1 percentage point from 2019 to 2014 (IRR=1.19; 95% CI 1.02 – 1.40).  The secondary objective found that as a city’s percentage of adults experiencing mental distress increased by one percent, the Incidence Rate of Violent Crime increased by 19% (IRR=1.19; 1.09 - 1.29).  

*Conclusion*: These results suggests that there is a statistically significant between some social factors and violent crime rates. Future research into different interventions that aim at solving upstream factors to crime is needed. As well research looking into the unique roles local policy can play.
